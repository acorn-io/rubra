# Benchmarks

When evaluating what LLM to use, it's important to consider the model's "intelligence" - which you can get an idea of with the following benchmark results. With these, you can determine which size and quality your use case requires.

:::info
[MT-bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/llm_judge/README.md) for all models was run in June 2024 using GPT-4.

MMLU, GPQA, GSM-8K & MATH were all calculated using the [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).

Our proprietary function calling benchmark will be open sourced in the coming months - half of it is composed of quickstart examples found in [gptscript](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/tree/main/examples).

:::::note
Some of the LLMs above require using custom libraries to post-process LLM generated tool calls. We followed those models' recommendations and guidelines in our evaluation.

`mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` required [mistral-inference](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference) library to extract function calls.

`NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B` required [hermes-function-calling](https://github.com/NousResearch/Hermes-Function-Calling).

`gorilla-llm/gorilla-openfunctions-v2` required special prompting detailed in their [Github repo](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/tree/main/openfunctions).

`Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B` required [nexusraven-pip](https://github.com/nexusflowai/nexusraven-pip).

`functionary-small-v2.5` and `functionary-medium-v3.0` models are tested using [MeetKai's functionary](https://github.com/MeetKai/functionary?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) with the vllm framework. For each model, we compared the results with functionary's `Grammar Sampling` feature enabled and disabled, taking the highest score from either configuration. The `functionary-small-v2.5` model achieved a higher score than the `functionary-medium-v3.0` model, primarily due to the medium model exhibiting more hallucinations in some of our more advanced test cases.

:::::

âˆ” `Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B` and `gorilla-llm/gorilla-openfunctions-v2` don't accept tool observations, the result of running a tool or function once the LLM calls it, so we appended the observation to the prompt.
