# Rubra

Rubra is an open-source ChatGPT. It's designed for users who want:

- **Multi-Model Support:** Rubra integrates with a variety of LLMs, including a local model optimized for Rubra, as well as models from OpenAI and Anthropic. More providers will be added in the future.
- **Assistant Tools:** Create powerful assistants using tools for web search, knowledge retrieval, and more, all designed to augment your LLMs with the information they need to be truly helpful.
- **OpenAI API Compatibility:** Use Rubra's OpenAI-compatible Assistants API, allowing you to use OpenAI's Python and JavaScript libraries to create and manage Assistants.
- **Self-Hosting:** Keep your data private and secure by running Rubra on your own hardware.

## Getting Started

    api_key=""
)

assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a customer support chatbot. Use your knowledge base to best respond to customer queries.",
  model="rubra_local",
  tools=[{"type": "retrieval"}],
  file_ids=[client.files.create(file=open("knowledge.txt", "rb"), purpose='assistants').id]
